## **Hi there 👋**

My name is Arian and i'm a soon to be engineering student with an interest in mechanical engineering and robotics.

Since I was young I've always been interested in building, the projects and means to finish them have just gotten more advanced.
&nbsp;
My main tech stack is Python and currently learning C++.
&nbsp;
Projects i'm working on:
- A digital self-driving program with ACC and NPC cars with visualization.
- Adding MPC logic to my temperature control.
- Control panel with facial recognition through OpenCV for access and a Raspberry Pi for core functionality like controlling temperature, measuring import qualities in the air and recommending courses of action, etc.
